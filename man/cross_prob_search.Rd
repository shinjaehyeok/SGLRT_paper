\title{Calculate the upper bound on the boundary crossing probability by using a grid-search}
\usage{
cross_prob_search(g, d, m_upper = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{Constant threshold (positive numeric).}

\item{d}{Bregman divergence between the null and alternative spaces (positive numeric).}

\item{m_upper}{Upper bound on the grid-search for m (default = 1e+3).}
}
\value{
Grid-search result of the upper bound on the boundary crossing probability based on Theorem 1.
}
\description{
Constant threshold for well-seperated case.
}
\examples{
cross_prob_search(1, 1)
cross_prob_search(2, 1, m_upper = 500)
